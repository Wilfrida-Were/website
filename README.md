## Retail Sales EDA in Python

Performed Customer segmentation by age and gender, identifying variations in daily and monthly spending patterns across product categories 

Analyzed customer demographics (age, gender) to understand their purchasing behaviour and identify key product categories for different customer segments.

## Mental Health EDA in Python

Used Pandas, as well as Seaborn and Matplotlib to investigate relationships between stress levels, mental health history, and treatment seeking among students, segmented by country and gender. 

Unveiled patterns in mental health data by analyzing factors like gender distribution across countries, occupations, and treatment-seeking behaviour 

## Retail Sales EDA in SQL

Leveraged SQL (SQLite3) to analyze retail sales data, extracting insights on customer demographics, purchasing behaviour by product category, and price variations 

Shared a tutorial of how to use SQLite3 in Jupyter Notebook

I will be exploring and sharing more projects on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wilfridawere/code).
