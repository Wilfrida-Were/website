title: "Data Analyst | Problem Solver | Lifelong Learner"

I'm a data enthusiast who thrives on solving problems with data. I use Python, SQL, and Tableau to clean data, create clear visuals, and uncover hidden insights.

Beyond Data:

When I'm not diving into datasets, you can find me strategizing over chess ♟️, rocking out on guitar , learning languages or kicking a soccer ball ⚽️. I also enjoy the challenge of computer troubleshooting, keeping my problem-solving skills sharp.
