title: "Data Analyst"

**Welcome!** I‚Äôm Wilfrida Were, a Data Analytics, Data Science, and Machine Learning enthusiast on a mission to build a community where curiosity and collaboration drive growth. I believe the best learning comes from sharing knowledge openly, making mistakes, and supporting each other along the way.

With a background in data analytics and a growing portfolio on platforms like Kaggle and GitHub, I‚Äôm here to make the journey through data accessible and engaging. My goal is to create a space where anyone can learn, connect, and grow‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre new to data or further along in your own journey.

When I‚Äôm not exploring datasets, I enjoy strategizing over chess ‚ôüÔ∏è, rocking out on guitar üé∏, learning new languages, and playing football ‚öΩÔ∏è. My love for problem-solving extends beyond data to anything that challenges me to think critically and improve.

I invite you to join me on this journey as we **explore** the world of data together!
