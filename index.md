title: "Data Analyst"

As a Data Analyst, I can help you navigate the sea of data and unlock hidden insights that drive business success. 

I leverage SQL to extract relevant data, then use Python's analytical power to clean and analyze it, revealing hidden patterns and customer trends. Finally, I create clear and concise dashboards with Tableau, empowering your leadership to make data-driven decisions for marketing and efficiency.

Beyond Data:

When I'm not diving into datasets, you can find me strategizing over chess ♟️, rocking out on guitar , learning languages or playing football ⚽️. I also enjoy the challenge of computer troubleshooting, keeping my problem-solving skills sharp.
