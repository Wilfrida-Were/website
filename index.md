title: "Data Analyst"

**Welcome!** I’m Wilfrida Were, a Data Analytics, Data Science, and Machine Learning enthusiast on a mission to build a community where curiosity and collaboration drive growth. I believe the best learning comes from sharing knowledge openly, making mistakes, and supporting each other along the way.

With a background in data analytics and a portfolio on platforms like Kaggle and GitHub, I’m here to make the journey through data accessible and engaging. My goal is to create a space where anyone can learn, connect, and grow—whether you’re new to data or further along in your own journey.

When I’m not exploring datasets, I enjoy strategizing over chess ♟️, rocking out on guitar 🎸, learning new languages, and playing football ⚽️. My love for problem-solving extends beyond data to anything that challenges me to think critically and improve.

I invite you to join me on this journey as we **explore** the world of data together!
